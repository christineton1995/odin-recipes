        <p>I was so excited when I came across this recipe from 
            the <em>Hungry Huy</em> blog by Huy.This is my 
            absolute all time favorite recipe. It is 
            so easy, and healthy. It always reminds me of home. 
            The wonderful taste of fresh herbs with cooked shrimp
            and soft texture of the rice paper, just cannot be 
            beat.</p>
