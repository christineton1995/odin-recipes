        <img src="goi-cuon-picture.jpg" alt="Goi Cuon picture">
        <p>I was so excited when I came across this recipe from 
            the <em>Hungry Huy</em> blog by Huy.This is my 
            absolute all time favorite recipe. It is 
            so easy, and healthy. It always reminds me of home. 
            The wonderful taste of fresh herbs with cooked shrimp
            and soft texture of the rice paper, just cannot be 
            beat.</p>

          </ul>
        <h4>Peanut Dipping Sauce</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp oil</li>
            <li>2 tbsp minced garlic</li>
            <li>8 tbsp hoisin sauce</li>
            <li>2-3 tbsp peanut butter</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>chili paste <em>optional</em></li>
          </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Add pork, onion, salt and sugar to a small pot and
                 add enough water to cover about 1 inch above the 
                 pork. Bring to a boil on high heat and then lower
                  to medium and cook for about 25-30 minutes or 
                  until pork juices run clear when poked at the 
                  thickest part, or it registers 145 F with an 
                  instant read thermometer at the thickest part.</li>
            <li>Cover the pork in a bowl as it cools so it doesn't
                 darken. Once cool, slice the pork as thinly as 
                 you can to make rolling easier later.</li>
            <li>Defrost shrimp in water bowl. Once defrosted, de-vein 
                the shrimp. Hold a shrimp up to a light to locate the 
                vein, pierce the whiter part (joint) of the shrimp just 
                below the vein with a toothpick, and pull the toothpick
                upwards towards the shrimp back. Do this slowly to remove 
                the vein. Piece again at another joint if the vein breaks 
                to remove all traces of vein. Repeat with all your shrimp.</li>
            <li>Cook the shrimp: add shrimp, salt, and enough water in a small 
                pot to barely cover your shrimp. Boil on medium-high heat for 
                only about 1.5 to 2.5 minutes or until the shrimp is no longer
                translucent. Drain and run under cold water to stop the cooking 
                process.</li>
            <li>Remove the shells and tails from shrimp, and cut the shrimp in 
                half along the body.</li>
            <li>Cook either your rice noodles according to the package instructions. 
                Timing can vary wildly depending on noodle thickness and brand. 
                This can be anywhere from 2 to 10 minutes. Drain and cool the 
                noodles under cold, running water to stop it from cooking 
                further.</li>
            <li>Prepare your vegetables by rinsing and drying them.</li>
            <li>Add warm water to a plate and soak the rice paper sheet for about 
                5-10 seconds. Soak the rice paper just enough so that it is 
                pliable and easy to handle, but remove the sheet before it 
                gets too soft and sticky. Lay rice paper on a plate and begin 
                to assemble your roll.</li>
            <li>Add lettuce towards the bottom of the rice paper. Leave 1 to 1Â½ 
                inches of space on either side of the rice paper. Layer with 
                mint and chives. Try to not add too many items because it will
                be harder to roll and might tear your rice paper.</li>
            <li>Add shrimp in the middle of the rice paper with the orange skin 
                facing down.</li>
            <li>Layer the sliced pork on top of the shrimp.</li>
            <li>Add the noodles across the vegetables, spread evenly across.</li>
            <li>Fold the left and right sides towards the middle so that it's snug. 
                Lay some chives lengthwise with one end poking out. Then fold 
                the bottom up to cover the noodles. You want to keep the roll 
                tight, so lightly squeeze it together as you roll. Continue 
                to roll upwards to complete the spring roll.</li>
            <li>In a pan over medium heat, saute garlic in oil until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add in hoisin sauce, peanut butter, and water and mix thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Bring to boil, and then immediately turn off the heat and pour 
                into a heat safe dipping bowl. The sauce will slightly thicken 
                as it cools.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle ground peanuts on each sauce dipping bowl, and leave the 
                chile paste on the side so others can add to their own dipping 
                bowl as desired.</li>
          </ol>
