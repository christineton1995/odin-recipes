        <img src="bo-luc-lac.jpg" alt="Bo Luc Lac picture">
        <p>This is one of the dishes that must be ordered when 
            visiting a Vietnamese restaurant. Dare I say I order 
            this much more often then Pho! I found this great recipe
            from <em>The New York Times-Cooking</em>, created by 
            Michael Huynh. Enjoy! </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>2 pounds boneless beef sirloin, fillet, or rib 
                eye, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
            <li>10 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Maggi seasoning or soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sea salt</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
          </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, combine beef, garlic, Maggi or soy sauce, sugar, 
                salt and black pepper to taste. Let stand at room 
                temperature for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>In a large serving bowl, combine onion, 2 minced garlic cloves, 
                sugar, salt, vinegar and olive oil. Mix well, and season with 
                black pepper to taste. Add lettuce, fennel, arugula, mint and 
                tomatoes. Toss to mix.</li>
            <li>Preheat a large skillet over high heat, and add vegetable oil. 
                Add remaining 5 cloves minced garlic. Add half the beef cubes 
                and sear on all sides, shaking pan, until medium rare, about 
                1 minute. Reserve, then repeat with remaining beef.</li>   
            <li>Transfer beef to salad greens and toss, or serve salad and beef 
                separately, divided among four plates. Sprinkle with freshly 
                ground black pepper. If desired, serve with rice or crusty 
                French bread.</li>
