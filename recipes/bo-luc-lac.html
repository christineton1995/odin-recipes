        <p>This is one of the dishes that must be ordered when 
            visiting a Vietnamese restaurant. Dare I say I order 
            this much more often then Pho! I found this great recipe
            from <em>The New York Times-Cooking</em>, created by 
            Michael Huynh. Enjoy! </p>
