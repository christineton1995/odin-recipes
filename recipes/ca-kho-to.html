        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>1 lb catfish filets</li>
            <li>salt to clean the fish</li>
            <li>2 tbsp oil</li>
            <li>5 cloves garlic minced</li>
            <li>1/2 yellow onion sliced</li>
            <li>1.5 tbsp fish sauce</li>
            <li>About 1/2 teaspoon thick soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 c water</li>
            <li>1/2 c coconut juice</li>
            <li>1 chile</li>
            <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
          </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Generously salt fish and rinse under water to clean it. 
                Set aside to dry.</li>
            <li>Add oil to a pan and saute garlic over medium heat 
                until lightly browned.</li>
            <li>Layer onion on top, then the fish, evenly spaced.</li>
            <li>Add the seasoning & cooking liquid (& optional chiles) 
                and turn the heat to high until boiling. Taste the sauce 
                and adjust the seasoning.</li>
            <li>Bring it to a simmer for ~20 minutes. Adjust seasoning 
                if needed.</li>
            <li>Gently flip the filets of fish over and simmer for a 
                final ~10 minutes with the lid partially covered.</li>
            <li>Stand there to watch it the final ~10 minutes to prevent 
                it from burning! During this time you can continually spoon 
                the sauce over the fish.</li>
            <li>Add green onion during last 2 minutes to wilt & top with 
                sliced chiles, and some freshly ground black pepper.</li>
          </ol>
